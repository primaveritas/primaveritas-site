        <p>
          Bryan Ziehl works at the intersection of maritime operations and structured systems discipline.
        </p>

        <p>
          He has supported commercial and government maritime programs across research vessels,
          tankers, container ships, and pre-positioned assets. His experience includes sea trials on
          newbuild vessels, Panama Canal transits involving controlled cargo, SL-7 and LMSR-class
          activations, and government-support missions within U.S. waters.
        </p>

        <p>
          He has worked directly with shipyard QA teams, bridge crews, inspectors, and external
          stakeholders in regulated environments where procedural accuracy and documentation
          integrity were critical.
        </p>

        <p>
          Repeated exposure to post-trial review, compliance verification, and cross-system
          reconstruction led to a focus on deterministic historical systems. Prima Veritas reflects
          that focus: objective sequencing, reproducible verification, and operational traceability
          without workflow disruption.

        Brookes
      </h2>

      <div class="mt-6 max-w-4xl text-sm text-off-white/80 space-y-4">

        <p>
          Brookes supports operational alignment and domain integration across pilot environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          His role focuses on deployment coordination, stakeholder communication, and ensuring
          that Prima Veritas integrates cleanly into existing operational contexts without
          introducing process friction.
        </p>

        <p>
          He works directly with operators and QA professionals to validate practical usefulness
          prior to broader rollout. The emphasis remains on measured implementation, technical
          clarity, and domain fit rather than feature expansion.
